# :robot: Sajosa SchedulerBot :robot:

A Slack bot that allows users to schedule reminders and meetings using natural language queries! Just install it on your Slack workspace and using it will be as intuitive as talking to a personal assistant. 

Under the hood: the project integrated Google OAuth, Google Calendar API, DialogFlow API, RTM API to parse natural-language user queries and control events in the users' google calendar according to their instructions, interacting with them in the Slack workspace intelligently.
